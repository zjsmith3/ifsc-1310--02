    <h2>reflection writing on space x project</h2>
    <p> 
      In the last few months of taking web technologies, I have learned a lot. My initial interest in making websites in general was never really that high. I knew that there was use for the skill, but not one that would probably benefit me. But when my advisor told me to take the class I decided it couldn’t hurt. When I started learning html and css it was fun. I learned that the thought process behind it was close to coding on c++ or java, but had a more creative twist to it. This ties in with my final project. In general, it was pretty hard. I didn’t even know where to start and I felt overwhelmed. Honestly I still don’t really know if I did anything cool or correctly, however, I know I did my best. When I showed my family and friends they gave me encouragement, they thought it was cool, and told me this skill could actually hold real value like having a website for my resume. That’s why when the revision came around I made sure that I tried my best. It looked funny but I took everything into account. The first draft it was hard for some people to read some of the text so I changed the fonts, and I made the pictures in a better spot for people to see. It also took a while for me to find a background picture I thought was still readable but still super cool. In general, the final project really stumped me around the part of having to position everything. For some reason I had a gap under my footer and it took forever to get it out. Or my pictures wouldn’t align the way I wanted. One cool thing I did was get the dragon logo to sit on the line between the title picture and the body picture. It might look like a mistake but I think it looks cool. In conclusion, I'm happy I took the class. I hope there’s a minor I can do for web technology.

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is a way to design and create websites with the thought of including everyone, no matter the browser. Having the mindset of making sure the content is there, and well delivered, so no matter what browser, the user can digest the content. Then you can add a layer of css. This makes the website deliver content, but also look good while doing it. Finally, there is the awesome last layer of css. This is where you can add pizzazz to your website. Awesome code that adds a layer of cool features that wouldn’t be possible without. To put it plainly, like https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/
      This article did, …it gives us basic user experience and cross compatibility across browsers to ensure stability. Now this doesn’t mean that you it’s impossible to make your website look good while having it accessible to all the web browsers. According to the linked article, your still able to use things like cool fonts and features. It’s just good to make sure you check to make sure that your website works without those features, and that in general the majority of people can use your website. In conclusion Progressive Enhancement is important all around the internet to make it a better time for anyone, no matter what kind of browser you use. </p>
    <h2>Web Accessibility writing</h2>
    <p>From watching the video and doing research, I can say that web accessibility doesn’t just stem from wanting to make your websites more accessible to those who aren't lucky enough to have normal functionality, but also shows the quality of work that someone does on the website. To have your site be accessible for everyone it first has to be created in a well manner. Like using progressive enhancements. Meaning using HTML for core content and behavior, css for presentation, and javascript for advanced behavior. This also means using universal behaviors in symbols. Like yellow triangles mean warnings and green check marks are good. There’s many layers when it comes to web accessibility that people can and do take to make the internet an easier place to traverse. And the interesting thing is that web accessibility tends to make sites more successful. This is due to the fact that when a site is accessible, that means it is well made, meaning more people will share it. So there’s more interest in making accessible sites than just for the good of the people. In the end of the day web accessibility is a very interesting topic with many layers, and personally holds importance for all the advantages it gives sites, like more publicity, success.  </p>
